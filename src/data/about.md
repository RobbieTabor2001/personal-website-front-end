# Robert Tabor

## Intro

Hello! My name is Robert Tabor, and I am deeply engaged in the realms of backend and iOS development, residing in the vibrant city of Boston. My journey in technology is rooted in a comprehensive background in computer science and economics obtained from Northeastern University. Originating from Pittsburgh, my formative years were filled with a diverse array of hobbies, from skiing and engaging in high school sports to immersing myself in video games. These experiences not only fueled my passion for technology but also led to a profound appreciation for Boston's rich historical and cultural tapestry.

In addition to my technological pursuits, I have cultivated a deep interest in fashion history and vintage clothing. This passion has become an integral part of my identity, offering a unique perspective on the world around me. My professional interests lie in the intricate aspects of data, software architecture, and backend development. However, my expertise extends into full stack development as well. I am always eager to collaborate and lend my expertise to projects that align with my skills and interests.
